# LeapGlove Project

## Overview
The **LeapGlove Project** aims to repurpose the [LucidGloves](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves) to control the [LeapHand](https://v1.leaphand.com/) while retaining the haptic feedback capabilities of the glove. 

This initiative focuses on creating an affordable, human-computer interaction interface for the LeapHand.
